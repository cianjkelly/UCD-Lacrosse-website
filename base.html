        <h3>ABOUT LACROSSE</h3>
        <p>
            Lacrosse is a Native American Iroquois sport, that was used as symbolic warfare
            to honour the Creator. While the original pitch length could have been anywhere
            from 500 meters to 3 kilometres long, with teams ranging from 100 to 1,000-a-side,
            the modern day game boasts a more standard 100m pitch with 11 players on each team
            for men's lacrosse, and 12 for women's lacrosse.
            <br>
            The game consists of passing and catching the ball in the
            air with a lacrosse stick (or crosse), to keep possession and ultimately
            score against the opposition. While the ball is allowed to touch the ground, you are
            not allowed to handle the ball and it must be picked up using the stick. There are dedicated
            positions similar to other sports, divided into attack, midfield, defence, and goalkeeper.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Women's Lacrosse</h4>
        <p>
            The game is played with 12 players per team on the field (1 goalkeeper). Like
            other field sports there are different playing positions on the team: attack,
            midfield, and defence. It is a predominantly non-contact sport.
            <br>
            <br>
        <hr>
        <h4>Men's Lacrosse</h4>
            It is played with two types of sticks, a field player's stick and a goalkeeper's stick.
        </p>

        <p>
            The field stick is designed to throw the ball at a fast pace.
            <br>
            The goalkeeper's stick has a wide face to defend the goals.<br>
            The "draw" is how play is starts or restarts after a goal.<br>
            Checking is when a player uses her own stick to hits an opponent's
            stick with the aim of turning over possession.<br>
            Scoring - goals are scored when the whole ball goes completely
            over the goal line, within the goal posts (6m x 6m). Play can
            continue behind the goal line (like ice hockey).<br>
            Cradling - as the pocket of the stick is shallow,
            cradling is a movement that allows the player to move
            without the ball falling out of the pocket.
            <br>
